Installations Details:

If you've cloned the repository to your local machine, you'll need to follow these standard steps to get the application running:

Install Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website.

Navigate to the project directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the root of the cloned repository.

Install dependencies: Run the following command to install all the necessary project dependencies:


npm install
Start the development server: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the script defined in package.json:


npm run dev
After running npm run dev, the application will typically be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port, which will be displayed in your terminal).
